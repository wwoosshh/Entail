# Changelog

## 1.0.0

A redesign. 0.3.0 was a set of checks and resolvers for cases that had been measured one by one; 1.0 is one
mechanism for all of them: facts that say what a value means, read from what declares them, compared where they are
used, under one policy and in one record. Everything listed was measured on the engines and versions in the README
(one RTX 4070 Ti); the README's "How it was measured" and "Known gaps" give the results and the limits.

**Facts and verdicts**
- A closed vocabulary of what a value means (version 3): layout and quantization, RoPE and position frames, valid
  ranges and KV extents, model properties, prediction type and latent scale, chat template, key coverage, reduction
  state, epochs, assumptions and precedence. Each fact carries where it came from and how certain it is.
- Five verdicts at every boundary: `pass`, `resolved`, `broken`, `refused`, `unknown`.

**Where facts come from**
- Model folders and files: `config.json`, the tokenizer's chat template, safetensors metadata, GGUF keys, diffusers
  configs.
- Manifests for files that declare nothing: `entail infer` writes a draft, `entail pin` marks it reviewed; a manifest
  next to the file, or in a folder named by `ENTAIL_MANIFESTS`.
- Which consumer honours which fact is a table with its evidence; only measured entries are used for repairs.

**Where they are compared**
- At load: attention properties against each backend, RoPE, config keys nobody reads, tied embeddings against the
  checkpoint, vLLM's weights after repacking against the signatures of the steps that repack them, weights against the
  checkpoint file (`ENTAIL_SOURCE=1`).
- In containers: the KV cache contract on transformers, vLLM and SGLang; buffers read after an in-place write; CUDA
  graphs and compiled code reused for inputs they were not made for.
- Per request, on vLLM's OpenAI server: the chat template, the reasoning history and tool-call format a model
  declares, request fields and template settings nothing reads. The core also has a rule for the context a prompt
  needs against what the model declares; no engine adapter calls it yet.
- In code, in debug mode: `@entail.boundary` declares what each argument means; strided layouts, quantized values and
  chunk-relative positions are converted where the reader needs them.
- Image models on ComfyUI and diffusers: prediction type and latent scale against the sampler and the VAE, and whether
  a LoRA reaches the model it is applied to.

**Policy and record**
- A mismatch is repaired first. What nothing can repair is reported as `broken` and the run goes on;
  `ENTAIL_ON_BROKEN=stop` (or `Name=stop` in `ENTAIL_FACT_POLICY`) stops before any output. `ENTAIL_POLICY=refuse`
  repairs nothing and reports everything.
- Everything entail says goes to `entail_logs/` in the folder a program starts from: a log and a JSON record of every
  decision, from every process an engine starts.

**When the output is still wrong**
- `entail locate` names the first boundary that did not keep a fact, or says that every checked boundary held.
- `diagnose.watch` and `diagnose.compare` compare a layer with a reference on the same inputs; `diagnose.propagating()`
  follows declared facts through tensor operations and names the one that made a fact untrue.
- `pytest --entail` runs each test that way, and `entail_conditions` runs a test once per condition a model's
  declarations put at stake.

**For new code (experimental)**
- `entail.frontend`: role-typed values and keyword-only operations, checked when a program is traced; a Qwen3 decode
  step written with it, lowered to torch, FlexAttention or a Triton kernel.

**Changed from 0.3.0**
- A mismatch nothing repairs is reported and the run goes on; 0.3.0 stopped. Set `ENTAIL_ON_BROKEN=stop` to stop.
- A checkpoint that declares nothing is reported as unknown. 0.3.0 judged the prediction type from the first model
  call; a checkpoint whose marker was lost now needs a manifest.
- A LoRA that reaches only part of the model is `broken` (0.3.0: a one-line note), and a sampling setting the user
  chose against the checkpoint's declaration is reported instead of passed over.
- The fault injection, the layout ledger and the bookkeeping probe used to measure entail left the package, and with
  them `ENTAIL_SEED`, `ENTAIL_LEDGER` and `ENTAIL_PROBE`.

## 0.3.0

ComfyUI: a check for v-prediction checkpoints that lost their marker; a sampling schedule kept with the object that set
it (ComfyUI #16490).

## 0.2.0

ComfyUI: a check for LoRAs that cannot reach the model.

## 0.1.0

RoPE settings passed under their transformers-4 names, and attention backends that drop a declared model property,
resolved; start-up checks (attention properties, swallowed config keys, tied embeddings, vLLM's weight layout,
weights against the checkpoint) and the KV cache contract on transformers, vLLM and SGLang; the start-up hook that
reaches engine worker processes.
